#Emotion Detection with CNN (Image Classification Project)

##Overview:
This project is about building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial images into two emotions: happy (0) and sad (1). The model is built using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, and it achieves over 90% validation accuracy. It also consistently shows good convergence between training and validation loss.

##Tools & Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib

##Data Preprocessing:
Resizing: All images were resized to a uniform shape for consistency.
Normalization: Pixel values were scaled to the range [0, 1].

##Training & Validation:
The model was trained with over 90% validation accuracy.
The training and validation losses converged well, indicating that the model was learning effectively.

##Evaluation:
The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using accuracy and loss plots to ensure good convergence during training.
I manually tested the model with facial images sourced from Google Images to verify its emotion classification capability.
